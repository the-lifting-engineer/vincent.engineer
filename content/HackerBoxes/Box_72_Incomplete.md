The Box:  

This was a fun box to tackle, the main things I learned from this box was using RFID based chips and antennas. The reason this is fun is because it appeals to my more base instincts of wanting to read data, especially the type I shouldn't be able to. 
Although this box came with some suggested projects I will only be reviewing the code for these.
